# Sentiment Analysis 

Sentiment analysis of Revolut user reviews to assess baseline platform trust as a necessary condition for stablecoin adoption. Part of MSIN0032 Management Science Dissertation, UCL.

## Overview

The pipeline scrapes, cleans, scores, and thematically codes user reviews of Revolut from five sources. It produces aggregate sentiment distributions, segment-level breakdowns, and theme-by-valence tables used in Part II of the dissertation.

## Pipeline Scripts (run in order)

| Step | Script | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|
| — | `keyword_filter.py` | Shared module. Classifies review text into three flags: `is_crypto`, `is_trust_concern`, `is_fx`. Uses word-boundary regex to avoid false positives. Imported by other scripts, not run directly. |
| 0 | `00_refilter.py` | Applies keyword filter to all raw scraped data. Forces `is_crypto=True` on all Revolut X reviews. |
| 1 | `01_scrape_trustpilot.py` | Scrapes Revolut Trustpilot reviews via `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON extraction. |
| 2a | `02_scrape_google_play.py` | Scrapes main Revolut app reviews from Google Play (`com.revolut.revolut`). |
| 2b | `02b_scrape_google_play_revolut_x.py` | Scrapes Revolut X reviews from Google Play (`com.revolut.revolutx`). |
| 3a | `03_scrape_app_store.py` | Scrapes main Revolut app reviews from Apple App Store RSS (ID `932493382`). |
| 3b | `03b_scrape_app_store_revolut_x.py` | Scrapes Revolut X reviews from Apple App Store RSS (ID `6502614478`). |
| 4 | `04_clean_reviews.py` | Merges all five sources into a single dataset. Deduplicates, detects language (English only), parses dates, and runs fuzzy near-duplicate matching. |
| 5 | `05_run_vader.py` | Runs both baseline VADER and extended VADER (with 23 crypto-domain lexicon additions) on cleaned reviews. Outputs compound scores for both. |
| 6 | `06_analyse_distribution.py` | Produces sentiment histograms, bimodality coefficient, star-vs-VADER crosstab, Spearman correlation, and platform-level breakdowns. |
| 7 | `07_build_coding_sample.py` | Builds a stratified thematic subsample (default 100 negative, 100 positive, 40 neutral by VADER compound). Preserves existing codes when extending sample size. |
| 8 | `08_aggregate_themes.py` | Aggregates manually coded themes. Produces theme frequency tables, segment-level breakdowns, theme-by-focus-with-valence tables, VADER miscode audit, and robustness checks (star-stratified vs VADER-stratified). |

### Utility scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `diagnose_preservation.py` | Debugging tool to verify code preservation when rebuilding the sample. |
| `restore_sheets.py` | Restores codebook/instructions sheets if they are lost during Excel operations. |

## Directory Structure

The scripts expect the following folder layout (created automatically on first run):

```
project_root/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/              # Output from scrapers (steps 1–3)
│   ├── filtered/         # Output from step 0
│   └── clean/            # Output from step 4 onwards
├── tables/               # Output tables from steps 6 and 8
├── figures/              # Output charts from step 6
├── keyword_filter.py
├── 00_refilter.py
├── 01_scrape_trustpilot.py
├── ...
├── 08_aggregate_themes.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Setup

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/joelthomas21/sentiment-analysis-msin0032.git
cd sentiment-analysis-msin0032

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Pipeline

> **Note for markers**: Steps 1–3 (scrapers) require a residential IP address. 
> Google Play, App Store, and Trustpilot block requests from cloud or 
> institutional networks. The cleaned and coded data is already provided 
> in `data/clean/`, so you can skip directly to step 4.

### If you want to reproduce the scraping (optional)
Run from a personal machine on a home network:

```bash
# Scrape (run from local machine)
python 01_scrape_trustpilot.py
python 02_scrape_google_play.py
python 02b_scrape_google_play_revolut_x.py
python 03_scrape_app_store.py
python 03b_scrape_app_store_revolut_x.py

# Filter
python 00_refilter.py
```

### To reproduce the analysis (start here)
```bash
# Clean and merge
python 04_clean_reviews.py

# Score sentiment
python 05_run_vader.py

# Analyse distribution
python 06_analyse_distribution.py

# Build coding sample
python 07_build_coding_sample.py

# After manual coding in the output Excel file, aggregate themes
python 08_aggregate_themes.py
```

**Note on step 7 → 8**: `07_build_coding_sample.py` outputs an Excel file in `data/clean/` that must be manually coded before running step 8. The coding process involves assigning primary/secondary focus categories and theme codes to each review in the spreadsheet. The codebook sheet in the Excel file documents all 14 themes and their definitions. Cleaned and coded data is included in data/clean/. Raw scraped data is not included but can be regenerated by running the scraper scripts.
